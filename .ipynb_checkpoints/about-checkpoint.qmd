I graduated from IIT Bombay 2014 with B.Tech in Civil Engg.

This is where i share my self leaning jouney and the lessons learned during my projects, spanning notebook-driven development, artificial intelligence and software design.

Previously I held positions of quant analyst, pricing fixed income products and derivatives, then worked as market risk analyst in a global Re Insurance firm (SwissRe). Before all of this i was a national athelete praticipating a laser and enterprise sailing with some successes.

I LOVE SPORTS and TECH!
